CFLUX is a real-time consesus based flow monitoring tool for the Nexus9k platform


## Business/Technical Challenge

Realtime multicast flow visibility in data center networks is becoming crucial to ensure mission critical delivery of new high value payloads. While some tools exist to visualize data paths, nothing is currently available to provide real-time packet level confidence monitoring on a per-flow basis.


## Proposed Solution

CFLUX leverages streaming telemetry of RTP packet sequences within the N9k (FX, FX2, and beyond) to create consensus-based health analytics on per-flow basis.


### Cisco Products Technologies/ Services
